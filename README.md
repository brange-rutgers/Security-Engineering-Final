# Security-Engineering-Final
Welcome to the Rutgers 2016 Security Engineering final project.

In this project we implemented a software simulation of a man in the middle attack on the communication between a SIM card and device, assuming that the MITM had access to read, modify, and block packets in either direction.

This project was implemented on debain based linux, ie Ubuntu, Mint

Crypto++ libraries install

sudo apt-get install libcrypto++9 libcrypto++9-dbg libcrypto++-dev

The demo does not require click, only the crypto++ libraries.
